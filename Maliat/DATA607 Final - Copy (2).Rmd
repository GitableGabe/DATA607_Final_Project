<span style="color: cornflowerblue;font-size:25px;">Policy on Collaboration</span>

You may work in a team of up to three people. Each project team member is responsible for understanding and being able to explain all of the submitted project code. Remember that you can take work that you find elsewhere as a base to build on, but you need to acknowledge the source, so that I base your grade on what you contributed, not on what you started with!

<span style="color: cornflowerblue;font-size:25px;">Approval Meeting</span>

Once you’ve turned in your one paragraph proposal, I want to schedule a 15 minute phone meeting with each person or team
(starting when we return from Thanksgiving break), where you’ll describe the reason (benefit) for doing this work and/or
question you’re seeking to answer, where you’ll source the data, and the overall flow. For team projects, I also want you to
articulate the roles and responsibilities of each team member.

<span style="color: cornflowerblue;font-size:25px;">Final Project Checklist</span>

To receive full credit, you’ll need to deliver on all of the items in the checklist below. Please read carefully through this checklist
before you make your project proposal. You are (within these checklist constraints) strongly urged to limit scope and make the
necessary simplifying assumptions so that you can deliver your work on time!

## Scope

![](Article.png)
With COVID-19 impacting employment worldwide, many articles have been published highlighting the toll it has taken on specific demographics. Our motivation to dive deeper into the impact by demographics, has been influenced by articles such as [**COVID-19 has spurred America’s first female recession**](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/covid-19-has-spurred-americas-first-female-recession). These articles talk about the negative affect, this pandemic has had on women in the United States. Using data from the [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/), we hope to identify if the impact was disproportionate or great to women vs. men.

## Data Preparation {.tabset .tabset-pills}

### Load Data

In order to conduct our studies we used data from [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics | Labor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey](https://www.bls.gov/cps/tables.htm#empstat) specifically data regarding:

* [Table 9 : *Employed persons by occupation, sex, and age*](https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat09.htm)
* [Table 10: *Employed persons by occupation, race, Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, and sex*](https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat10.htm)


<!------- * [Table 34: *Unemployed jobseekers by sex, reason for unemployment, and active jobsearch methods used*](https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat34.htm) --------->

The data was imported by encapsulating the functions `as.dataframe()`, `html_table()` and `read_html`, the subsetting. 

```{r class.source = "fold-hide"}
url_9  <- "https://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cpseea09.htm"
url_10 <- "https://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cpseea10.htm"
url_30 <- "https://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cpseea30.htm"

```

<font size="5" color = "navy blue">Table 9 Data</font>
```{r class.source = "fold-hide"}
head(df_tb9  <- as.data.frame(html_table(read_html(url_9))[[2]]),5)%>%
  reactable(highlight = TRUE, pagination = FALSE, height = 450)
```


<br>
________________________________________________________________________________
<br>

<font size="5" color = "navy blue">Table 10 Data</font>

```{r class.source = "fold-hide"}
head(df_tb10 <- as.data.frame(html_table(read_html(url_10))[[2]]),5)%>%
  reactable(highlight = TRUE, pagination = FALSE, height = 450)
```

<font size="5" color = "navy blue">Table 30 Data</font>

```{r class.source = "fold-hide"}
df_tb30 <- as.data.frame(html_table(read_html(url_30))[[2]])
head(df_tb30 <- as.data.frame(html_table(read_html(url_30))[[2]]),10)%>%
  reactable(highlight = TRUE, pagination = TRUE, height = 850)


```
#### Table30

```{r}
df_tb30<-
  bind_rows(df_tb30[3,],df_tb30[5:33,])%>%
    select(-2,-3)

colnames(df_tb30)<-
  c("Occupation_Label", "TotalUnemployedRatesApril2020",
    "TotalUnemployedRatesApril2021", "Men_Unemployment_Rate_2020",
    "Men_Unemployment_Rate_2021", "Women_Unemployment_Rate_2020", "Women_Unemployment_Rate_2021")
```

```{r}
df_tb30_t <-
  df_tb30%>%
    rownames_to_column() %>%
      pivot_longer(-rowname, 'variable', 'value') %>%
        pivot_wider(variable, rowname)%>%
          janitor::row_to_names(1)
```


###Dropping unnecessary column:

```{r}
df_tb30_n1%>%
  pivot_table(
        .rows       = c(~ TotalUnemployedRatesApril2020, ~ mean(TotalUnemployedRatesApril2021)),
        .columns    = ~ Occupation_Label,
        .values     = ~ COUNT()
    )


```

```{r}
describe(df_tb30_n1)
```

```{r}
test<-as.data.frame(t(df_tb30_n1 %>%
  select(TotalUnemployedRatesApril2020, TotalUnemployedRatesApril2021)))
```


### Transform Data

Data manipulation and $tidying$ included:

* relabeling column values to reflect a **(***4 digit: year***)** $-$ **(***2 digit: month***)** (`%y%m`) format.
* subsetting data frames to remove unnecessary data or blank rows with the help of piping `%>%`
* categorizing data with a `Gender` column, that included a `Male`,`Female` and `Total` value respectively.
  **Note:** Total value was used to to specify data that reflect total unemployment counts.

```{r class.source = "fold-hide", results='hide'}
colnames(df_tb10) <- c("Label","2020-03", "2020-04",
                         "2020-05", "2020-06", "2020-07",
                         "2020-08", "2020-09", "2020-10",
                         "2020-11", "2020-12","2021-01",
                         "2021-02", "2021-03")
                              

colnames(df_tb9) <- c("Label", "2020-03", "2020-04",
                         "2020-05", "2020-06", "2020-07",
                         "2020-08", "2020-09", "2020-10",
                         "2020-11", "2020-12","2021-01",
                         "2021-02", "2021-03")
```

```{r}
df_tb9_tdy<-
    as.data.frame(df_tb9[1,]%>%
      assign_in(list(1,1),"Month")%>%
        bind_rows(df_tb9[3:14,],
          df_tb9[16:27,],
          df_tb9[29:40,])
    )
# Adding male and female category
df_tb9_tdy$Gender<-"Total"
df_tb9_tdy$Gender[14:25] <- "Male"
df_tb9_tdy$Gender[26:37] <- "Female"
```

And repeated for `Table 10`.

```{r class.source = "fold-hide"}
df_tb10_tdy<-
    as.data.frame(df_tb10[1,]%>%
      assign_in(list(1,1),"Month")%>%
        bind_rows(df_tb10[3:14,],
          df_tb10[16:27,],
          df_tb10[29:40,])
    )

# Adding male and female category
df_tb10_tdy$Gender<-"Total"
df_tb10_tdy$Gender[14:25] <- "Male"
df_tb10_tdy$Gender[26:37] <- "Female"
```

This $tidy$ data (`df_tb9_tdy`,`df_tb10_tdy`) is the baseline used for our evaluation of the comparison between unemployment rates of men and women, during the beginning month until present day, of the pandemic. 

Using [**ZevRoss: Know Your Data | Easy multi-panel plots in R using facet_wrap() and facet_grid() from ggplot2**](http://zevross.com/blog/2019/04/02/easy-multi-panel-plots-in-r-using-facet_wrap-and-facet_grid-from-ggplot2/) as a point of reference, we continue to transform the data.\newline

Specifically:

* `regex` is used within the `gsub()` function, to remove `,` from our `Rate` column.
* `Month` and `Rate` is then transformed to data types that will allow for further analysis.


```{r class.source = "fold-hide"}
#Dependency on df_tb10_tdy    Rate, Gender, Age Group
df_tb10_ln <- as.data.frame(df_tb10_tdy %>% 
  slice(c(16,17,19,22,23,24,25,28,29,31,34,35,36,37)) %>% 
    gather("Month_Year", "Rate", 2:14)%>%
      lapply(function(x){ 
        gsub(",", "", x)}))
```

```{r class.source = "fold-hide"}
df_tb10_ln$Month_Year<- as.yearmon(df_tb10_ln$Month_Year) 
df_tb10_ln$Rate <- as.numeric(df_tb10_ln$Rate)
```

The data is stored to `df_tb10_ln`. When sorted, it is easy to see that the highest unemployment rates overall, did occur among women between the ages of $16\ to\ 19$, during the months of $March\ and\ April\ of\ 2020$, by a small margin over men $18\ to\ 19$ in $March\ \&\ April\ 2020$

```{r, echo= FALSE}
head(df_tb10_ln[with(df_tb10_ln, order(-Rate)),])%>%
  kbl(row.names = FALSE) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped",position = "center", full_width = T)
```

From here we calculate rates and store the values to `df_tb9_rt`. The data is transformed in a month over month format, so that it can be assessed as a trend throughout the year. The functions used to create this data frame included:

* piping `%>%`
* `slice()`
* `gather()`
* `mutate()`

This data frame is grouped by `Gender` specifically.

Dates and counts are converted with `as.yearmon()` & `as.numeric()`.

The calculations for our month-over-month (`MoM`) values and month-over-month rates (`MoM_Rates`) were as follows:

$MoM= \frac{Count - lag(Count)}{lag(Count)}$ 
$MoM\_Rate =MoM\times100 :rounded\ to\ the\ tenth$ 

where [`lag()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/lag) is a time series shift from the `stats` package.


```{r class.source = "fold-hide"}
# Month over Month employment rate change by gender 
#Dependency on df_tb9_tdy:     Rate and Gender
df_tb9_rt <- df_tb9_tdy %>% 
  slice(c(14,26)) %>% 
    gather("Month_Year", "Count", 2:14)

df_tb9_rt$Month_Year<- as.yearmon(df_tb9_rt$Month_Year)
df_tb9_rt$Count <- as.numeric(gsub(",","",df_tb9_rt$Count))

df_tb9_rt <- 
    df_tb9_rt %>% 
      group_by(Gender) %>% 
        mutate(MoM = (Count - lag(Count)) / lag(Count)) %>% 
          mutate(MoM_Rate =  round(MoM * 100, 2))
```

The result is a data frame with rates for ages $16\ and\ over$ (or all age groups).

```{r, echo= FALSE,class.source = "fold-hide", results='show'}
head(df_tb9_rt[with(df_tb9_rt, order(- MoM_Rate)),])%>%
  kbl(row.names = FALSE) %>%
  kable_paper(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F)
```

Following a similar approach, but grouping by `Gender` & `Label` we create data frame `df_tb9_MoM` and can see the impact for each age bracket.

```{r class.source = "fold-hide"}
# Month over Month employment rate change by age and gender 
#Dependency on df_tb9_tdy:     Count, age, and Gender

df_tb9_MoM <- df_tb9_tdy %>% 
  slice(c(16,17,19,22,23,24,25,28,29,31,34,35,36,37)) %>% 
  gather("Month_Year", "Count", 2:14)

df_tb9_MoM$Month_Year<- as.yearmon(df_tb9_MoM$Month_Year) 
df_tb9_MoM$Count <- as.numeric(gsub(",","",df_tb9_MoM$Count))

df_tb9_MoM <- df_tb9_MoM %>% 
  group_by(Gender, Label) %>% 
  mutate(MoM = (Count - lag(Count)) / lag(Count)) %>% 
  mutate(MoM_Rate =  round(MoM * 100, 1))
```

```{r class.source = "fold-hide", echo= FALSE, results='show'}
arrange(df_tb9_MoM,Label)[15:25,]%>%
  kbl(row.names = FALSE) %>%
    kable_paper(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F)
```

Finally for our linear trend analysis `df_tb10_trend` is created for an additional perspective of unemployment by demographic by year.

```{r class.source = "fold-hide"}
#Dependency on df_tb10_tdy:     Rate and Gender
#data transformation operation: from wide to long function: gather, package: tidyr  
df_tb10_trend <- df_tb10_tdy %>% 
  slice(c(14,26)) %>% 
  gather("Month_Year", "Rate", 2:14)

#data transformation operation: date format function: as.yearmon, package: zoo  
df_tb10_trend$Month_Year<- as.yearmon(df_tb10_trend$Month_Year) 
df_tb10_trend$Rate <- as.numeric(df_tb10_trend$Rate)
```

```{r class.source = "fold-hide", echo= FALSE, results='show'}
head(df_tb10_trend,5)%>%
  kbl(row.names = FALSE) %>%
    kable_classic("striped", full_width = F)
```

### Exploratory Data Analysis



```{r class.source = "fold-hide"}
#testing linear model. issue: gender is categorical var- need to look into this
# only accounts for 1.18% of data, Multiple R-squared:  0.0118
summary(lm(Count~Gender, df_tb9_rt))
```

```{r class.source = "fold-hide"}
